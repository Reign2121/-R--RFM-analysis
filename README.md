## Evaluating customer value

고겍가치를 평가하는 일은 매우 중요합니다.


1.CLV computation

CLV

r = response rate

churn rate = 1 - r

d = discount rate

p is the average profit the customers will contribute in every period

CLV = (1+d)*p/d+c

__________

2.RFM

Recency, Frequency, Monetary

it is one of the good ways to evaluate "customers"

RFM Package in R & Targeting (same way as clv)

__________
reference

M = profit contribution margin

E(Z) = expected order amount given that the customer responds to the campaign

r = predicted response probability (Because of it, sometimes CLV is considered as a uncertain method)

C / m * E(Z) is the break-even response probability
expected profit = M × E(Z) × r − C
